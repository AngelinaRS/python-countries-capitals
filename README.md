# Countries and Capitals
	The goal for this project is that you can save, sort, show and send data 
	by email entered by the user, remember that you must meet each of the 
	requirements, then we show you what you should make.

#### **Country:**
	After receiving this command the program should ask the name of
	country and expect the corresponding input, as a second step should ask the
	name of the capital I just enter and wait for input
	corresponding. Following this should give me the message:
	"Thank you for adding a country with its capital".
 
#### **Countries:**
	I must give the list of countries already entered.
 
#### **Capitals:**
	I must give the list of capital already entered.
 
#### **All:**
	I must give the list of countries with related capital.
 
#### **All Sorted by Capital:**
	I must give the same result as all but ordering the outputs
	alphabetically by name of the capital.
 
#### **All Mail:**
	I must send an email to "lgarcia@cognits.co" with Everything
